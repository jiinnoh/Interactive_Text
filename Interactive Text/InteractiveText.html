	“Affirmative!” <em> the Commendatore said cheerfully. He nodded several times. </em> “You have a good head on your shoulders. Ideas cannot exist outside the perceptions of others—those perceptions are our sole source of energy.”

	“Negative! In theory, you have a point,” <em> the Commendatore said. </em> “But only in theory. In reality, that is quite unrealistic.

In the end, to stop thinking about something means to stop thinking about stopping thinking.”
